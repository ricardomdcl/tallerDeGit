I never thought that it'd be so simple but
I found a way, I found a way
I always thought that it's be too crazy but
I found a way, I found a way
If you open up your mind (see what's inside)

It's gonna take some time to realign
But if you look inside
I'm sure you'll find

Over your shoulder you know that I told you
I'll always be picking you up when you're down
So just turn around

Now that I know that anything is possible
I found a way, I found a way
No one can break what is so unbreakable
I found a way, I found a way
If you open up your mind (see what's inside)

It's gonna take some time to realign
But if you look inside
I'm sure you'll find

Over your shoulder you know that I told you
I'll always be picking you up when you're down
So just turn around

No one cares what you give
You know you gotta live like you wanna live
When it's time, to be free
You know you gotta be what you wanna be
If you open up your mind (see what's inside)

It's gonna take some time to realign
But if you look inside
I'm sure you'll find

Over your shoulder you know that I told you
I'll always be picking you up when you're down
So just turn around
